# Rheology Comics website

This is the homepage for the Rheology Comics project, funded by the Society of Rheology's 2023 Rheology Venture Fund.

# Website Theme

This website is built using the [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme) Starter Template, the fastest and easiest way to get the Agency Jekyll Theme  up and running on GitHub Pages!

To generate your own repository with this theme, click the 
[![template button](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Use%20this%20template-brightgreen)](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/generate) button, 
then replace the sample content with your own and configure for your needs.

The template and current theme implementation were developed by Ravi Riley. You can [support him on PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/raviriley) for continued work developing and maintaining it.

If you want your website to be at `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`, that's what you must name your repo. If you want it to be like this: `https://raviriley.github.io/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/`, them make sure the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` matches the name of your repo. You can also use a `CNAME` file and your own custom domain.
